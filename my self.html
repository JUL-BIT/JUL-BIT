            <h1>MY FAVOURITE MOVIE</h1>
            Title of the movie which is thrilling, fantastic and has been my favourite is <b>VAMPIRE DIARIES</b> <br>
            i have seen this movie for the umpteenth time. Its such a beautiful supernatural, horror and also a seasonal movie. <br>The last season is season 8, <br> it consists of beautiful casts, my favourite casts are NINA DOBREV as elena gilbert<br>
            PAUL WESLEY as stefan and STEVEN R.MCQUEEN as jeremy gilbert. <br>
            It spinned off from 
            <ol>
                <li><b>ORIGINALS</b></li>
                <li><b>LEGACIES</b></li>
            </ol> 
            It kicks off from where elena was living a normal life with her beloved brother jeremy,<br> then
            on her first day in high school there she met stefan and immediately feels a connection, <br>however what she does not know was that stefan and his brother were vampires. <br>
            I love when elena best friend <b>BONNIE BENNETH</b> realised that she had supernatural powers and could do alot of things. <br>
            It is all about love, respect and team work.
            It was produced by julie plec and kelvin williamson.
